# SMS Spam Detection Chrome Extension

This project is a **Chrome Extension** that detects SMS spam using a **Machine Learning Model** implemented with Python and Flask for the backend. The model is trained on a dataset of SMS messages and classifies them as **spam** or **ham (not spam)**. The extension allows users to check messages in real time for potential spam content.

## Setting Up the Chrome Extension
1. Open **Google Chrome** and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
2. Enable **Developer Mode** (top-right corner).
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `extension/` folder.
4. The extension will be added to your browser.

## Features
- Detects spam messages with high accuracy.
- Uses a Machine Learning model trained on SMS data.
- Backend built with Flask for model inference.
- Simple and user-friendly Chrome extension interface.


## Machine Learning Model
The model is trained on the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset**, which contains labeled SMS messages as spam or ham. The steps include:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Removing special characters and stopwords.
   - Converting text to lowercase.
   - Tokenization and vectorization using **TF-IDF**.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Trained a **Naive Bayes classifier** for text classification.
   - Achieved high accuracy in detecting spam.

3. **Deployment:**
   - The trained model is saved as `model.pkl`.
   - The TF-IDF vectorizer is saved as  `vectorizer.pkl`.
   - Flask backend loads the model and provides an API for prediction.
